### implement of TransRec is in the C_ModelTrain folder.
### Recommend u to upload the project in Pycharm where it be created

### However, u need download the raw dataset and use the tools in Y_DataCleanerKit to format it
### and the SASRec (in D_SASRec) is copy from authors' github: https://github.com/kang205/SASRec
### which means u need run it in shell (not Pycharm) and follow the manual given by author
